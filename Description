Explored the Qiskit implementation and security evaluation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, leveraging superposition and the no-cloning theorem for secure key exchange. Analyzed its robustness against quantum attacks like Photon Number Splitting and evaluated efficiency under eavesdropping and system noise conditions using Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER).
